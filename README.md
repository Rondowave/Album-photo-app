# Photo Album Application

## Overview

This project is a photo album application built with React.js. It allows users to manage albums and photos. The application consists of three main views:
1. Manage Users: Display a list of users with pagination (10 users per page).
2. Manage Albums: Display a list of albums for each user with functionalities to add, edit, or delete albums.
3. Manage Photos: Show all photos associated with each album with options to delete specific photos.

The user interface supports English and French, allowing users to switch between languages.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, Bootstrap 5, Apollo Client
- **Backend:** Node.js, Apollo Server, GraphQL
- **State Management:** React useState and useQuery hooks
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **Internalization:** i18next
- **Pagination:** Custom logic with React useState
- **Testing:** Manual testing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/photo-album-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd photo-album-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
5. Start the frontend development server:

   ```
6. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Client-side Routing:** Uses React Router for navigation between different views.
- **Error Handling:** The application gracefully handles errors and displays user-friendly messages.

## Future Enhancements

- **Redux Integration:** Optionally, integrate Redux for more complex state management.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a platform like Netlify or Vercel.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
